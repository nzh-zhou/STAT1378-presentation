## Data set

* The data set was scraped from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) (MAL) (@anime)
* MAL is currently the largest anime database

# Question 1: Do hentai animes have a lower average score compared to non-hentai animes?

## Definitions

* The Western definition of hentai is a genre of Japanese anime and manga that contains pornography.
* We will use H to denote the hentai anime population and N to denote the non-hentai anime population.

---

* In MAL, "Hentai" is a tag under "Genres". This is the what we will be using to classify if an anime is hentai or not.

```{r, out.width = "40%", fig.cap = "The information section of a hentai anime in MAL."}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/MALinfo1.png")
```

```{r q1}
q1 <- anime %>% select(Score, Genres) %>% 
  filter(!(Score == "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(Group = ifelse(str_detect(Genres, "Hentai"), "Hentai", "Not Hentai"))
```

## Hypotheses and Test Statistic

```{r}
n_H <- sum(q1$Group == "Hentai")
n_N <- sum(q1$Group == "Not Hentai")
tau <- paste0("$\\tau = \\frac{\\overline{X}_H -
              \\overline{X}_N}{\\sqrt{\\frac{S_H^2}{n_H}+\\frac{S_N^2}{n_N}}} =
              \\frac{\\overline{X}_H - 
              \\overline{X}_N}{\\sqrt{\\frac{S_H^2}{", 
              n_H, "}+\\frac{S_N^2}{", n_N, "}}}$")

sd_H <- sd(filter(q1, Group == "Hentai")$Score)
sd_N <- sd(filter(q1, Group == "Not Hentai")$Score)
df1 <- (sd_H^2/n_H + sd_N^2/n_N)^2 / 
  ((sd_H^2/n_H)^2 / (n_H - 1) + (sd_N^2/n_N)^2 / (n_N - 1))
dis <- paste0("$\\tau \\mathrel{\\dot \\sim} t_{", round(df1, 0), "} \\mathrel{\\dot =} Z$")
```

* We are testing: 
  - H$_0$: $\mu_H - \mu_N = 0$ against H$_1$: $\mu_H - \mu_N < 0$.
* Test statistic:
  - `r tau`
* If H$_0$ is true AND assumptions are satisfied:
  - `r dis`

## Assumptions

* Data from MAL is a random sample from each group population.
  - We exclude observations with an unknown score or genre.
* Observations are therefore independent of each other within and across each group.

---

```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "H"}
ggplot(q1, aes(sample = Score)) +
  geom_qq(size = 0.5) + geom_qq_line() + facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  labs(title = "Normal QQ Plots for Average Score \nfor each Group",
       x = "normal value", y = "height") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 24)
```

* The average score variable for each group seems to be normally distributed since the QQ plots mostly follow a straight line.

## Conducting the Test

* Since the statistical test assumptions are satisfied, we can now go ahead with the test.
* We use the function `t.test` in the `stats` package in R (@stats).

---

```{r ctt1}
test1 <- t.test(Score ~ Group, data = q1, alternative = "less")
tribble(
  ~ summary, ~value,
  "$\\tau_{obs}$", glue(signif(test1$statistic[['t']], 3)),
  "95\\% confidence interval for $\\mu_H - \\mu_N$", glue("[$-\\infty$, {signif(test1$conf.int[2], 3)}]"),
  "degrees of freedom", glue(round(test1$parameter[['df']], 0)),
  "p-value", glue(signif(test1$p.value, 2))
) %>% 
  kbl(col.names = NULL, escape = FALSE, align = "rl", 
      caption = "summary of the Welch two sample test") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

As seen in table 1, the p-value < < 5%, so we reject H$_0$.

## Discussion and Conclusion

* Our aim was to determine if the average score of hentai animes is lower than that of non-hentai animes.
* After testing the assumptions for the Welch two sample t-test and conducting it, we conclude that it is indeed lower.

# Question 2: Is the average score of animes the same across all release dates?

## Definitions

* The release date of an anime is the date that the first episode aired.
* MAL contains information on the air dates of animes under "Aired".

---

In figure 2, the release date of "Shinsekai yori" is Sep 29, 2012.

```{r, out.width = "40%", fig.cap = "The information section of Shinsekai yori in MAL."}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/MALinfo2.png")
```

```{r q2, warning = FALSE}
tab <- c(Jan = 0, Feb = 31, Mar = 59, Apr = 90, May = 120, Jun = 151, 
         Jul = 181, Aug = 212, Sep = 243, Oct = 273, Nov = 304, Dec = 334)

# account for month
q2 <- anime %>% select(Score, Aired) %>% 
  filter(!(Aired == "Unknown" | Score == "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(Release = unname(tab[str_sub(Aired, 1, 3)]/365))

subs <- q2$Aired %>% str_sub(5, 6) %>% as.numeric() %>% is.na()

# account for day
q2$Release[subs] <- q2$Release[subs] + 
  q2$Aired[subs] %>% str_sub(5, 5) %>% as.numeric()/365
q2$Release[!subs] <- q2$Release[!subs] + 
  q2$Aired[!subs] %>% str_sub(5, 6) %>% as.numeric()/365

# account for year
q2$Release[subs] <- q2$Release[subs] + 
  q2$Aired[subs] %>% str_sub(8, 11) %>% as.numeric()
q2$Release[!subs] <- q2$Release[!subs] + 
  q2$Aired[!subs] %>% str_sub(9, 12) %>% as.numeric()


### some air dates only have month and year or year only
q2$Release[q2$Release < 1700] <- NA
temp <- q2

temp$Aired[subs] <- temp$Aired[subs] %>% str_sub(8, 11)
temp$Aired[!subs] <- temp$Aired[!subs] %>% str_sub(9, 12)
temp$Aired <- as.numeric(temp$Aired)

## month and year
# account for month
q2$Release[is.na(temp$Release)] <- unname(tab[str_sub(q2$Aired, 1, 3)]/365)

# account for year
q2$Release[is.na(temp$Release)] <- q2$Release[is.na(temp$Release)] +
  q2$Aired[is.na(temp$Release)] %>% str_sub(6, 9) %>% as.numeric()

## year only
q2$Release[is.na(q2$Release)] <- q2$Aired[is.na(q2$Release)] %>% 
  str_sub(1, 4) %>% as.numeric()
```

## Hypotheses and Test Statistic

Let the independent variable, $X$, be release date, and the dependent variable, $Y$, be average score.

* We are testing: 
  - H$_0$: $\beta = 0$ against H$_1$: $\beta \neq 0$.
* Test statistic:
  - $\tau = \frac{\hat\beta}{s_{Y|X}/\sqrt{S_{XX}}}$
* If H$_0$ is true AND assumptions are satisfied:
  - `r paste0("$\\tau \\sim t_{", nrow(q2) - 2, "} \\mathrel{\\dot =} Z$")`

## Assumptions

* Data from MAL is a random sample from the anime population.
  - We exclude observations with an unknown score or release date.
* Observations are therefore independent of each other.

```{r}
# average score vs. release date
ggplot(q2, aes(x = Release, y = Score)) + geom_point(size = 0.3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ x) + 
  labs(title = "Average Score vs. Release Date", 
       x = "release date", y = "average score") + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 24)
```

---

```{r}
lm2 <- lm(q2$Score ~ q2$Release)
# regression residuals vs. fitted values
ggplot(data.frame(x = lm2$fitted.values, y = lm2$residuals), 
       aes(x, y)) + geom_point(size = 0.3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x) + 
  labs(title = "Regression Residuals vs. Fitted Values", 
       x = "fitted values", y = "residuals") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 24)
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(x = lm2$residuals), aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Regression Residuals", 
       x = "residual bins") + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 24)
```

---

* There seems to be a linear trend between average score and release date.
* For any value of the fitted value, the residuals seem to be normally distributed with a constant variance.

## Conducting the Test

* Since the statistical test assumptions are satisfied, we can now go ahead with the test.
* We use the function `lm` in the `stats` package in R (@stats).

---

```{r ctt2}
slm2 <- summary(lm2)
tribble(
  ~ summary, ~value,
  "$\\hat\\beta$", glue(signif(slm2$coefficients[2, 1], 2)),
  "95\\% confidence interval for $\\beta$", glue("[{signif(confint(lm2)[2, 1], 2)}, {signif(confint(lm2)[2, 2], 2)}]"),
  "t-value", glue(signif(slm2$coefficients[2, 3], 3)),
  "degrees of freedom", glue(slm2$df[2]),
  "p-value", glue(signif(slm2$coefficients[2, 4], 2))
) %>% 
  kbl(col.names = NULL, escape = FALSE, align = "rl", 
      caption = "summary of the linear regression coefficient t-test") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

As seen in table 2, the p-value < < 5%, so we reject H$_0$.

## Discussion and Conclusion

* Our aim was to determine if the average score of animes is the same across all release dates.
* After testing the assumptions for the linear regression coefficient t-test and conducting it, we conclude that it is not the same across release dates, but rather it increases by about `r signif(slm2$coefficients[2, 1], 2)` each year.

## Thank you!

Thank you for your attention!

I hope that this has answered all your anime curiosities.
